# Synthetic Character Generation Pipeline

A containerised pipeline for generating consistent Flux-style synthetic characters using Stable Diffusion XL and LoRA adapters. Built for realism, prompt adherence, and NSFW compatibility.

## Features
- ⚡ Consistent character generation via LoRA
- 🧠 Powered by Stable Diffusion XL
- 🐳 Dockerised for RunPod and local use
- 🧪 Includes basic unit and e2e tests

## Install Dependencies (Locally or in Docker)

If you're running the pipeline **outside Docker**, install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t flux-character-gen .
```

### Run the generator:

```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all -v $(pwd)/outputs:/app/outputs flux-character-gen
```

Generated outputs will appear in the `outputs/` directory.

## LoRA Model

This project uses the [Flux Realism LoRA from XLabs-AI](https://huggingface.co/XLabs-AI/flux-RealismLora/tree/main) for consistent character features.

## Requirements

- NVIDIA GPU with compatible drivers
- Docker with GPU support

## Project Structure

- `inference/` – generation scripts and pipeline logic  
- `models/loras/` – LoRA adapter configs  
- `tests/` – unit and integration tests  
- `outputs/` – generated images (created at runtime)
